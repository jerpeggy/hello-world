Not a complete copy- paste.

I'm Joshua Pegg, but I go by JR. I'm 17 at the time of this writing, and a sophomore of Computer Science at Ball State University. I like video games, programming, and the color green. I hope to one day program for a triple-A game studio, or at least have my work appear at E3.

This is actually painfully boring. It will definitely help me use GitHub, but it feels so bland and unoriginal. No challenge, maybe? I don't know...
